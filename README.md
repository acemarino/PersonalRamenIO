## Installation

Use the package manager npm to install all needed external packages and libraries. Running this command
will install all dependencies that are included in the files.

```
npm install
```

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) must also be installed on your computer.

A dump of the database is available in the ramen_io_db.sql file in the repository. Use that file to
recreate an instance of the database on your local computer.

## Running the project

Use the package manager npm to start a local host instance of the site.
Your database server should be active before launching.

```
npm run dev
```
